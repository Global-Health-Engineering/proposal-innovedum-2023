Here is a quiz I created based on the web page [Data visualisation](^2^). The quiz has five multiple choice questions, each with four possible answers. Choose the best answer for each question and check your answers at the end.

1. What is the main goal of data visualization according to the web page?
    - A) To make data look beautiful and impressive
    - B) To communicate information clearly and effectively
    - C) To explore data interactively and dynamically
    - D) To manipulate data to support a certain argument
2. What are the three key components of a ggplot2 plot?
    - A) Data, aesthetics, and geoms
    - B) Data, layers, and scales
    - C) Data, mappings, and facets
    - D) Data, coordinates, and themes
3. What is the difference between position and coordinate adjustments in ggplot2?
    - A) Position adjustments change how geoms are arranged on the plot, while coordinate adjustments change how the plot is drawn on the page
    - B) Position adjustments change how the plot is drawn on the page, while coordinate adjustments change how geoms are arranged on the plot
    - C) Position adjustments change how aesthetics are mapped to variables, while coordinate adjustments change how variables are scaled to values
    - D) Position adjustments change how variables are scaled to values, while coordinate adjustments change how aesthetics are mapped to variables
4. What is one way to add labels to a ggplot2 plot?
    - A) Using the labs() function to specify the title, subtitle, caption, and axis labels
    - B) Using the annotate() function to add text annotations to specific locations on the plot
    - C) Using the ggrepel package to add text labels that avoid overlapping with other elements
    - D) All of the above
5. What is one advantage of using faceting in ggplot2?
    - A) It allows you to create multiple plots with different data sources in a single figure
    - B) It allows you to create multiple plots with different aesthetics in a single figure
    - C) It allows you to create multiple plots that share axes and scales in a single figure
    - D) It allows you to create multiple plots that have different themes and layouts in a single figure

Answer key:

1. B) To communicate information clearly and effectively. This is stated in the first paragraph of the web page.
2. A) Data, aesthetics, and geoms. These are the three components of a ggplot2 plot as explained in section 3.1.
3. A) Position adjustments change how geoms are arranged on the plot, while coordinate adjustments change how the plot is drawn on the page. This is the definition given in section 3.6.
4. D) All of the above. All three methods can be used to add labels to a ggplot2 plot as shown in sections 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.
5. C) It allows you to create multiple plots that share axes and scales in a single figure. This is one of the benefits of faceting as described in section 3.7.
