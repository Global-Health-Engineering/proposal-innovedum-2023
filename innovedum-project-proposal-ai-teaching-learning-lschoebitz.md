Programmieranfänger, verbesserte Lernmethoden und LLM-Einsatz in
Prüfungen. Ziel ist auch, eine Community of Practice zu etablieren, die
KI’s Rolle in der Datenwissenschaft betont.

## 1.2. Project summary (ca. 140/200 words; will be published in the project database).

### English

The Global Health Engineering group offers a course titled “Research
Beyond the Lab (rbtl)”, which imparts training on out-of-lab research
projects, emphasising open science principles and effective research
data management.

A critical component is teaching data science with the R statistical
programming language. Given the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs)
capable of auto-generating accurate programming solutions, there’s a
need to integrate these tools responsibly into the curriculum. This
Innovedum project delineates four main challenges:

- Ensuring responsible AI use
- Guiding novices to find answers to programming tasks
- Improving retrieval practice to enhance student learning
- Leveraging LLMs for coding exam settings

An overarching outcome of the project is to foster collaboration with
other ETH initiatives and beyond, positioning the project not merely as
an educational overhaul but also as a catalyst for building a robust
community of practice centred on AI in data science education.

### German

Die Gruppe Global Health Engineering bietet einen Kurs mit dem Titel
“Research Beyond the Lab (rbtl)” an, der Schulungen zu
Forschungsprojekten außerhalb des Labors vermittelt und dabei die
Grundsätze von Open Science und des effektiven
Forschungsdatenmanagements (Research Data Management) betont.

Ein wichtiger Bestandteil ist der Unterricht in Datenwissenschaft mit
der statistischen Programmiersprache R. Angesichts des Aufkommens von
Large Language Models (LLMs), die in der Lage sind, automatisch genaue
Programmierlösungen zu generieren, besteht die Notwendigkeit, diese
Werkzeuge verantwortungsvoll in den Lehrplan zu integrieren. In diesem
Innovedum-Projekt werden vier wesentliche Herausforderungen beschrieben:

- Sicherstellung einer verantwortungsvollen Nutzung von KI
- Anleitung von Anfängern bei der Suche nach Antworten auf
  Programmieraufgaben
- Verbesserung der Abfragepraxis, um das Lernen der Studenten zu
  verbessern
- Nutzung von LLMs für Prüfungen

Ein übergreifendes Ergebnis des Projekts ist die Förderung der
Zusammenarbeit mit anderen ETH-Initiativen und darüber hinaus, wobei das
Projekt nicht nur als Überholung der Ausbildung, sondern auch als
Katalysator für den Aufbau einer robusten Community of Practice, die
sich auf KI in der Data-Science-Ausbildung konzentriert, positioniert
wird.

# 2. Consultation

## 2.1. Student involvement: Describe whether and how students were involved in the preparation and review of this project application. How will students be involved in project implementation?

The project implementation will be in coordination and collaboration
with students that participate in our course (rbtl: Research beyond the
lab) in spring semester 2024. They will be directly involved in the
project implementation and will support the evaluation process. Results
will then be used for the course in spring semester 2025.

## 2.2. Who advised you on your project and/or who gave you feedback on it (e.g. LET / Educational Developer(s) / department(s) / other faculty / other)?

An initial project idea was shared with Daniela Eawason as a response to
the announcement of the new focal point topic. We shared our idea with
Katrin Bentel (LET) who we have been continuously in touch with about
open science ideas and computational reproducibility for about 1.5
years. We then shared our project idea with Kathrin Bentel and Julia
Kehl (both LET) who we met personally to discuss. Their advice was
integrated into a draft proposal, which was shared once more.

The draft proposal was also shared with employees of the Global Health
Engineering group. Elizabeth Tilley (head of group) and Mian Zhong (Data
Scientist and expert in Natural Language Processing) provided detailed
feedback on the proposal.

We are aware of several other initiatives around the use of AI in
teaching and learning at ETH. In addition to communicating the project
ideas with the Innovedum and LET teams, we will actively reach out to
other professionals at ETH to contribute to building a community of
practice, including Manuel Sudau, Educational Developer with LET, Dennis
Kochmann at D-MAVT, Christian Franck at D-ITET, Meike Akveld & Andreas
Steiger at D-MATH and their product STACK, and lastly the applicants for
the most recently funded Innovedum projects with a focus on exploring AI
in academic writing (Lucio Isa & Melanie Paschke).

# 3. Project description

## 3.1. Starting position: Describe the current situation. What didactic and disciplinary challenges does your project address? (max 324/250 words). Info: Show the relevance of and the need leading to the project. List (if applicable) preliminary work to remedy the situation.

At the Global Health Engineering group, we teach a class (rbtl: Research
Beyond the Lab) on conducting a research project out of the lab and
applying open science principles and effective research data management.
Amongst other data science tools, students learn to use the R
statistical programming language, for which we assume no prior
knowledge.

With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and associated tools, such
classes risk not providing added value to students if teachers miss out
on including LLMs in their teaching. Students can now auto-generate
solutions to programming assessments with high accuracy (Denny et al.
2023). A structured, defined, open approach is needed to encourage
students to use such tools responsibly while teachers can enhance the
learning experience and increase their efficiency and productivity.

This project addresses the following didactic and disciplinary
challenges:

**Challenge 1:** Ensuring students use AI responsibly and effectively
while developing their critical thinking, problem-solving and
programming skills.

We will teach students how to use AI tools and discuss the ethical
implications of using LLMs in programming, including the potential for
over-reliance on AI-generated solutions and the importance of developing
problem-solving skills.

**Challenge 2:** Helping students navigate the overwhelming amount of
information available online to receive solutions to their coding
problems.

LLMs have shown great potential to provide coding support from plain
language descriptions. Once students know how to phrase an appropriate
prompt, they will receive coherent functional examples.

**Challenge 3:** Enhancing retrieval practice, improving student
learning, and enriching the learning experience in a time-constrained
environment.

Preparing up-to-date formative assessments and authentic examples
requires much time and thought. LLMs show great potential to automate
parts of this process. Additionally, AI can serve as a creative engine
to prepare analogies that support students in class, further enriching
the learning experience (Mollick and Mollick 2023).

**Challenge 4:** Applying the knowledge and skills gained throughout the
course to analyse data, draw conclusions, and demonstrate programming
proficiency in a time-limited exam setting that allows for the use of
LLMs.

## 3.2. Project goals: List the concrete project goals. (232/250 words). Info: 3 to 5 clear measurable objectives. Please fill the fields in German and English. The information will be published in Innovedum Public.

Each identified challenge is addressed by an associated work package,
goal and measurable objective as presented in this public Google Sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1srD0UPBMVknayk0ni6iOma07yHvpzAOYg3jS2KEYVOI/edit#gid=0
and Table 1 in the Appendix.

We identified two to three specific activities per objective, which are
presented in this public Google Sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ATIyMmpVnVfX8Z17WUYYu1wjMx6rNA4snTOpVj4V5hM/edit#gid=0
and Table 2 in the Appendix.

### WP1 - Responsible AI use

**Goal:** Integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into lectures and
require it as a mandatory tool in class.

**Objective 1:** Within 12 months after the start of the project, a
usage policy for LLMs and an associated teaching module is being re-used
by other classes at ETH or beyond.

### WP2 - AI as a Tutor

**Goal:** Use LLMs to provide code examples and support novices to find
answers to programming tasks.

**Objective 2:** Ensure that 95% of AI-generated code examples and
solutions are accurate, relevant, and helpful for novice programmers.

### WP3 - Enhance Learning

**Goal:** Use LLMs to create low-stakes tests for formative assessments
(faded examples/scaffolding, Parsons problems, multiple choice quizzes).

**Objective 1:** Reduce the required time for generating formative
assessments for R programming concepts by 90%.

### WP4 - Student Assesment

**Goal:** Develop a technical programming exam that allows students to
use LLMs.

**Objective 1:** Achieve a grade distribution in the final exam where at
least 80% of the students score between 5 and 6, with no more than 10%
scoring the maximum grade of 6.

## 3.3. Project progression: Describe the progression of the project (288/300 words). Info box: Describe the different phases of the project.

We present a rough timeline for project activities in Table 2 of the
Appendix. This timeline translates into five project phases.

### Phase 0 - before project funding

We implement this project in a course we teach in Spring Semester 2024
(rbtl-fs24). Therefore, it is essential to include information about the
usage of AI in the course catalogue now. Students need to be aware of
the usage of AI.

### Phase 1 - human resources and choice of AI tools

The project’s first phase will identify a suitable candidate (Scientific
Assistant) to support the project during the development and
implementation phases. Further, we will make the exact choice of AI
tools during this phase. Our current thinking is to ask students to use
free versions of Perplexity (perplexity.ai), an AI tool that allows for
free GPT-4 LLM usage.

### Phase 2 - development of course material

While the syllabus and overall objectives for each module of the class
will be defined at the before the start of the course in February 2024,
we will prepare the class material flexibly, allowing for the inclusion
of learnings from the use of AI.

### Phase 3 - evaluation and dissemination

After the course is completed, the project team will analyse and compile
all materials that were generated as part of the work packages. We will
analyse student evaluation surveys and present results to the scientific
community.

### Phase 4 - integration of learning into future course material

As a final phase, the learnings from the project will be integrated into
material for the next class in Spring Term 2025 (rbtl-fs25) and other
courses that teach programming concepts.

## 3.4. Timetable and milestones

TODO: Add in online form.

## 3.5. Teaching/Learning concept: Explain the didactic principles (e.g. experiences, theories and methods) which underpin your project. (279/300 words). Explain the didactic methodology that underpins the project. This can be your own experience (of that of other lectures) of didactic theories and methods from the literature.

The idea of using AI to help students with coding problems in R is based
on the premise that novices in programming struggle to find help online,
and AI tools can provide better code examples if students are taught how
to use the relevant prompts. Several didactic theories and methods
underpin this idea:

1.  **Co-creation and collaboration**: Co-creation in AI-assisted
    learning involves students working with AI tools to solve problems
    and learn new concepts. This approach has been explored in studies
    such as the one on AI-generated programming code in higher education
    (Jonsson and Tholander 2022). The study found that AI tools can
    facilitate understanding and learning while improving the creative
    processes by promoting reflection and through the exploration of
    alternative solutions. These findings align with the didactic theory
    of constructivism, which emphasises that learners actively construct
    their understanding and knowledge through experiences and
    interactions.

2.  **Personalised learning**: AI tools can offer personalised learning
    experiences by adapting to individual students’ needs, preferences,
    and learning styles. This approach is supported by the idea that
    learners have different ways of processing information and that
    tailored instruction can lead to better learning outcomes (Kaiss,
    Mansouri, and Poirier 2023). The approach is connected to
    self-determination theory, which defines three drivers of intrinsic
    motivation (competence, autonomy, relatedness), all positively
    impacted by personalised learning.

3.  **Connectivism:** Within the classroom, we will engage and interact
    with the AI tools as a class, in small groups, and individually. The
    newest feature of Perplexity allows people to have shared
    Collections of prompt threads. It enables people to craft prompts
    together, share them with others, and make them public. This
    practice is supported by the theory of connectivism, which
    emphasises the importance of networks, social interactions, and the
    use of technology in the learning process.

## 3.6. Target group(s)

- done in online form

## 3.7. Effects of the project: Describe the innovative aspects of your project and describe its expected effects and added value for teaching and learning at ETH for all of the following: (167/250 words). These aspects should be different from the normal advancement of teaching. Further benefits and effects can also be listed here.

Beyond the measurable objectives, the over-arching effect of this
project will be to shift the culture around AI from shame and secrecy to
one that promotes and embraces the practical and enjoyable aspects of
this emerging technology. Through this project, we will demonstrate to
educators (who may still be sceptical) that AI has a place in teaching
and that it allows students and teachers to spend more time learning,
discussing, and engaging and less time searching and running failed
code.

### Students

- being aware of the limitations of using AI
- being aware of the responsibility for using AI and critically
  evaluating all its output
- learning how to use AI for learning a new programming language
- learning how to use AI for debugging code

### Faculty

- learning how to use AI to deliver more engaging classes
- demonstrating the time-saving benefits related to assignment and exam
  preparation

### The entire degree programme

- learning how to use AI
- embracing a culture of AI use
- belonging to a community of practice for use of AI in teaching and
  learning

## 3.8. Evaluation strategy: Describe the evaluation strategy you will use to check achievement of project goals (see 3.2) and effects on teaching (see 3.7). (250 words)

- What approaches will you use?
- Are you planning measures for identifying interim results? If so, how
  will these results flow back into the project?

To verify the achievement of project goals and related objectives, we
will work with Nore Dietmann from LET to support us in developing a
student evaluation survey that explicitly targets ‘WP1 Responsible AI
use’, and ‘WP2 AI as a Tutor’. We will implement one survey after
teaching the 3-hour AI module, another survey at the end of the course,
and a follow-up survey six months after course completion. In
combination, these three surveys will help identify student
satisfaction, improve course material, and ensure that the expected
innovative effects are taking place.

We will receive interim results throughout the entire implementation
phase, as students are explicitly asked to share their prompts and
critically reflect on their usage. This process will allow results to
flow back into the project as it is implemented. It is an interactive
exercise and dialogue with participating students as they are using the
AI tools.

As presented in Section 3.2, the defined objectives have a measurable
outcome. We will use them to evaluate if the objectives were achieved.
The evaluation results will be used to design activities for the
continuation and iteration of the project.

## 3.9. Project staff: Employees or students involved in the project and their roles

Add in online form.

# 4.Sustainability and dissemination

## 4.1.Sustainability: How will project results be maintained and utilised after the funding period? What project results can prospectively be utilised within ETH? Do you need additional funding for this? (265/300 words)

During the funding period, the project will be implemented twice within
the same class (rbtl-fs24 and rbtl-fs25), and evaluated in collaboration
with LET. For this, we will work with Nora Dietmann, who will support us
in developing a student evaluation survey that explicitly targets the
project’s objectives. The evaluation results will feed back into
re-development course material, implemented and evaluated once again
with our rbtl-fs-25 cohort of students.

We will actively communicate project progress and results to the ETH
community and beyond using several media types and fora (see Section 4.2
Project communication). The project material is published as Open
Educational Material with permissive licences and in an adaptable and
reusable format (see Section 4.2 Project Communication & Section 5.2
Accessibility and e-Accessibility).

This project will last 18 months, and we aim to apply for another
Innovedum focal point project on March 1st 2025, which will ensure the
mid-term continuation of the project for another 18 months from July
2025 to December 2025. The objectives of this second round of funding
will primarily focus on rolling out developed modules with identified
partners at ETH (e.g., the Computational Competencies initiative, Data
Stewardship Network).

Beyond these three years, the utilisation of project results and
long-term maintenance will be ensured by the fact that the project lead,
Lars Schöbitz, holds a permanent contract at the Global Health
Engineering research group at D-MAVT. He is not a researcher but holds
the position of an administrative technical assistant (Open Science
Specialist & Data Steward). The research group is committed to the
long-term continuation and scale-up of courses related to this project.

## 4.2. Project communication: How do you plan to publicise and document the progress of the project? What form will the final report for the Innovedum project database take? How will you disseminate project results? (308/300 words). Info: Interested ETH members should be able to gain insight into the project and the results. How do you ensure this?

This proposal, progress updates and project outputs will be published on
GitHub with open and permissive licences as they are developed.

Each course we teach has a public website with access to all course
materials. In addition, we will develop a project-dedicated website to
highlight unique aspects of the project, and will share a final report
in an accessible and interactive format. We will also share this report
in the Innovedum public project database.

The project team is part of several networks and committees related to
open science and data stewardship. We will use these established
networks to take the opportunity to present the project at a minimum of
two hosted events (ETH Library Data Stewardship Network, Swiss
Reproducibility Network Working Groups).

We will share our first experiences at and contribute to the Innovation
Learning & Teaching Fair 2024. “Refresh Teaching” is another platform
and event for which we will prepare material to reach an even broader
community.

As part of our openwashdata project that is supported by the Open
Research Data Program of the ETH Board, we send a monthly newsletter to
110 (5% growth/week) people who are interested in applying open data
practices in the greater water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector.
Still, we will also highlight this project as it aligns with our overall
mission to empower learners of all levels to engage with open data
practices. This work will undoubtedly resonate with many members of the
community.

We maintain an active LinkedIn account where we frequently highlight the
work of our students and our teaching; we will dedicate a series of
posts to this project, associated courses, and the links to the
Innovedum programme.

Recently, we started to host a blog on our GHE website with monthly
posts. We will dedicate several blog posts to this work, especially
after course completion, when we have quantitative data and personal
testimonials to report.

# 5. Data gathering and administration

## 5.1.Will the project involve the gathering of personal data?

No

## 5.2 Accessibility and e-Accessibility: How do you ensure the flexible usability and accessibility of the learning media and materials created in the project? (max ca. 265/300 words)

As open science advocates, we will publish all learning media and
materials as open educational resources. These resources play a vital
role in ensuring flexible usability and accessibility, allowing for the
customization and adaptation of content to suit various teaching styles
and students’ preferences. For instance, our public course website is
developed with Quarto open-source scientific and technical publishing
system. The underlying code is hosted as a GitHub repository using
permissive licences for all material (e.g. CC-BY-40, MIT License),
offering educators a platform to access, modify, share and contribute to
educational materials.

We will address all essential e-Accessibility features in our learning
materials. (1) Flexible Output: our course website and hosted material
will be available in HTML file format, allowing for the customization of
materials in a variety of ways, responsive design, and custom styles.
(2) Flexible input: ensured by our course website, all content will be
reachable using the computer mouse and keyboard. (3) Information &
Semantics: Our website will not contain scripted interactive components
but will be provided in native HTML and hosted as a static website,
ensuring the correct interpretation of content by screen readers. (4)
Images and Multimedia: Every used image, prepared diagram, or
visualisation will be prepared using the alternative text attribute in
HTML. We will use decision-making support, such as the
Alt-text-Decision-Tree of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), to
assess whether the provided text is meaningful and purposeful. We will
contact experts at ETH (Anton Bolfing) to check the correctness of
alternative texts. (5) Colours and Contrast: We will use
colorblind-friendly colour palettes in our design and tools to ensure
high contrast (e.g. colourcontrast.cc).
