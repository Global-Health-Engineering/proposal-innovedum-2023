The project idea of using AI to help students with coding problems in R is based on the premise that novices in programming struggle to find help online, and AI tools can provide better code examples if students are taught how to use the relevant prompts. This idea is underpinned by several didactic principles, experiences, theories, and methods.

1. **Co-creation and collaboration**: The concept of co-creation in AI-assisted learning involves students working together with AI tools to solve problems and learn new concepts. This approach has been explored in studies such as the one on AI-generated programming code in higher education[3]. The study found that the use of AI tools can serve as a resource for understanding and learning while also affecting creative processes.

2. **Learning by doing**: AI tools can provide students with hands-on experiences and opportunities to learn by doing. This approach aligns with constructivist learning theories, which emphasize the importance of active engagement and problem-solving in the learning process[2].

3. **Personalized learning**: AI tools can offer personalized learning experiences by adapting to individual students' needs, preferences, and learning styles. This approach is supported by the idea that learners have different ways of processing information and that tailored instruction can lead to better learning outcomes[5].

4. **Scaffolding**: AI tools can provide scaffolding to support students in their learning process. Scaffolding refers to the temporary support provided to learners to help them achieve a higher level of understanding or skill. As students become more proficient, the support can be gradually removed[9].

These resources provide insights into the didactic principles, theories, and methods that underpin the project idea of using AI to assist students with coding problems in R.
